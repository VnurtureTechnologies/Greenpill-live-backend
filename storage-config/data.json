However, the electric car draws power from a single source of the electric motor(s) to propel the vehicle.  While hybrid cars offer better fuel efficiency or longer distances/ranges, electric vehicles are still yet to reach that potential. That said, electric vehicles pollute lower emissions compared to hybrid cars who are dependent on an internal combustion engine. With researchers are advancing towards more power full batteries technology that drive more than 1000 KM in single charge and charge 0 to 80 percent in 30 Minutes, automobiles sector is gaining momentum building to roll out their next EV fleet. As petrol and diesel prices are sky rocketing day by day, the choice of buying EV instead of diesel car is looking a better option. ",

      "description": "Kutch is poised to become world’s largest Green hydrogen Hub. The region is known for barren land and white desert, is now attracting investment of more than 2 lakh Cr.  The 30000 MW Hybrid Renewable Energy Park and upcoming 4.75GW RE Park of NTPC REL, will produce Giga Watt Electricity and green hydrogen to power India's future energy needs.                                                                                                                                                                                     Region is also become one of the Integrated Green Energy Hub propose by National hydrogen Energy Mission (NHM) because of its strategic advantage of land mass availability, higher solar radiation and port connectivity for export market.
